			<p class= "chaptertwofirstp">What incredible pains the fancier of traditional architecture must take when he sets out to build a
house in pure Japanese style, striving somehow to make electric wires, gas pipes, and water lines
harmonize with the austerity of Japanese rooms—even someone who has never built a house for
himself must sense this when he visits a teahouse, a restaurant, or an inn. For the solitary
eccentric it is another matter, he can ignore the blessings of scientific civilization and retreat to
some forsaken corner of the countryside; but a man who has a familiy and lives I the city cannot
turn his back on the necessities of modern life—heating, electric lights, sanitary facilities—
merely for the sake of doing things the Japanese way</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sec-textctwo">
					<p class="chaptertwosecp">The purist may rack his brain over the
placement of a single telephone, hiding it behind the staircase or in a corner of the hallway,
wherever he thinks it will least offend the eye. He may bury the wires rather than hang them in
the garden, hide the switches in a closet or cupboard, run the cords behind a folding screen. Yet
for all his ingenuity, his efforts often impress us as nervous, fussy, excessively contrived. For so
accustomed are we to electric lights that the sight of a naked bulb beneath an ordinary mild glass
shade seems simpler and more natural than any gratuitous attempt to hide it. Seen at dusk as one
gazes out upon the countryside from the window of a train, the lonely light of a bulb under an
old-fashioned shade, shining dimly from behind the white paper shoji of a thatch-roofed
farmhouse, can seem positively elegant.</p>

				  <p class="chapterthirdsecp">But the snarl and the bulk of an electric fan remain a bit out of place in a Japanese room. The
ordinary householder, if he dislikes electric fans, can simply do without them. But if the family
business involves the entertainment of customers in summertime, the gentleman of the house
cannot afford to indulge his own tastes at the expense of others. A friend of mine, the proprietor
of a Chinese restaurant called the Kairakuen, is a thoroughgoing purist in matters architectural.
He deplores electric fans and long refused to have them in his restaurant, but the complaints from
customers with which he was faced every summer ultimately forced him to give in.</p>

<p>I myself have had similar experiences. A few years ago I spent a great deal more money than I
could afford to build a house. I fussed over every last fitting and fixture, and in every case
encountered difficulty. There was the shoji: for aesthetic reasons I did not want to use glass, and
yet paper alone would have posed problems of illumination and security. Much against my will, I
decided to cover the inside with paper and the outside with glass. This required a double frame,
thus raising the cost. Yet having gone to all this trouble, the effect was fair from pleasing. The
outside remained no more than a glass door; while within, the mellow softness of the paper was
destroyed by the glass that lay behind it. At that point I was sorry I had not just settled for glass to
begin with. Yet laugh though we may when the house is someone else’s we ourselves accept
defeat only after having a try at such schemes.</p>
				
			</div>
		<div class="text">
			  <p>Then there was the problem of lighting. In recent years several fixtures designed for Japanese
houses have come on the market, fixtures patterned after old floor lamps, ceiling lights, candle
stands, and the like. But I simple do not care for them, and instead searched in curio shops for old
lamps, which I fitted with electric light bulbs</p>
				
		  </div>
					<div class="text">
			  <p>What most taxed my ingenuity was the heating system. No stove worthy of the name will ever
look right in a Japanese room. Gas stoves burn with a terrific roar, and unless provided with a
chimney, quickly bring headaches. Electric stoves, though at least free from these defects, are
every bit as ugly as the rest. One solution would be to outfit the cupboards with heaters of the sort
used in streetcars. Yet without the red glow of the coals, the whole mood of winter is lost and 
with it the pleasure of family gatherings round the fire. The best plan I could devise was to build a
large sunken hearth, as in an old farmhouse. I this I installed an electric brazier, which worked
well both for boiling tea water and for heating the room. Expensive it was, but at least so far as
looks were concerned I counted it as one of my successes</p>
