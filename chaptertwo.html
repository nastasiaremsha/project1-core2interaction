							<p>Every time I am shown to an old, dimly lit, and, I would add, impeccably clean toilet in a Nara or
Kyoto temple, I am impressed with the singular virtues of Japanese architecture. The parlor may
have its charms, but the Japanese toilet is truly a place of spiritual repose. It always stands apart
from the main building, at the end of a corridor, in a grove fragrant with leaves and moss. No
words can describe that sensation as one sits in the dim light, basking in the faint glow reflected
from the shoji, lost in meditation or gazing out at the garden. </p>

							<p>As I have said there are certain prerequisites: a degree of dimness, absolute cleanliness, and quiet
so complete one can hear the hum of a mosquito. I love to listen from such a toilet to the sound of
softly falling rain, especially if it is a toilet of the Kantō region, with its long, narrow windows at
floor level; there one can listen with such a sense of intimacy to the raindrops falling from the
eaves and the trees, seeping into the earth as they wash over the base of a stone lantern and
freshen the moss about the stepping stones.The toilet is most aesthetic of all.  </p>

							<p>Making poetry of
everything in their lives, by rights should be the most unsanitary room in the
house into a place of unsurpassed elegance, replete with fond associations with the beauties of
nature. Compared to Westerners, who regard the toilet as utterly unclean and avoid even the
mention of it in polite conversation, we are far more sensible and certainly in better taste. The
Japanese toilet is a bit inconvenient to get to in the middle of the night and in winter there is always a danger that one might catch cold.
But as the poet Saitō Ryoku has said, “elegance is frigid.”   </p>

							<p>With taste for traditional architecture must agree that the Japanese toilet is perfection.
Yet whatever its virtues in a place like a temple, where the dwelling is large, the inhabitants few in an ordinary household it is no easy task to keep it clean.
No matter how fastidious one may be or how diligently one may scrub, dirt will show, 
particularly on a floor of wood or tatami matting. And so here too it turns out to be more hygienic
and efficient to install modern sanitary facilities—tile and a flush toilet—though at the price of
 affinity with “good taste” and the “beauties of nature.”   </p>

							<p> That burst of light from
those four white walls hardly puts one in a mood to relish Sōseki’s “physiological delight.” There
is no denying the cleanliness; every nook and corner is pure white. Yet what need is there to
remind us so forcefully of the issue of our own bodies. A beautiful woman, no matter how lovely
her skin, would be considered indecent were she to show her bare buttocks or feet in the presence
of others; and how very crude and tasteless to expose the toilet to such excessive illumination.
The cleanliness of what can be seen only calls up the more clearly thoughts of what cannot be
seen.   </p>

							<p>Though I did install modern sanitary facilities when I built my own house, I at least avoided tiles,
and had the floor done in camphor wood. To that extent I tried to create a Japanese atmosphere—
but was frustrated finally by the toilet fixtures themselves. As everyone knows, flush toilets are
made of pure white porcelain and have handles of sparkling metal. Were I able to have things my
own way. Wood
finished in glistening black lacquer is the very best; but even unfinished wood, as it darkens and
the grain grows more subtle with the years, acquires an inexplicable power to calm and sooth.    </p>
